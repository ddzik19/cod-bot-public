# COD-BOT

Cod Bot is a discord bot for the game Call of Duty Warzone. This is my personal project and not a school project. I have worked on this Discord bot by myself.

This discord bot is fully functioning and is hosted on Heroku.com

This bot can be invited to your discord server with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=934543703572369448&permissions=2147732544&scope=bot).

I have not created many issues or versions as my Git knowledge was not very good. Only used it as a backup system.

## Commands

- !cod.help
- !wz.meta = displays all meta guns
- !cod.mw = displays all guns from Cod Modern Warfare
- !cod.cw = displays all guns from Cod Cold War
- !cod.vg = displays all guns from Cod Vanguard
- !build.gunName = displays a gun build for specified gun (!build.kar98kmw)
